Each page's item count is determined by the getItemCountForPage callback if\n * provided by the caller, or 10 as default. Each page's height is determined by the getPageHeight callback if provided by\n * the caller, or by cached measurements if available, or by a running average, or a default fallback.\n *\n * The algorithm for rendering pages works like this:\n *\n * 1. Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\n * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\n * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\n * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\n *\n * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\n *\n * To optimize glass rendering performance, onShouldVirtualize can be set. When onShouldVirtualize return false,\n * List will run in fast mode (not virtualized) to render all items without any measurements to improve page load time. And we\n * start doing measurements and rendering in virtualized mode when items grows larger than this threshold.\n *\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\n */\nvar List = (function (_super) {\n    tslib_1.__extends(List, _super);\n    function List(props) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, props) || this;\n        _this.state = {\n            pages: []\n        };\n        _this._estimatedPageHeight = 0;\n        _this._totalEstimates = 0;\n        _this._requiredWindowsAhead = 0;\n        _this._requiredWindowsBehind = 0;\n        // Track the measure version for everything.\n        _this._measureVersion = 0;\n        // Ensure that scrolls are lazy updated.\n        _this._onAsyncScroll = _this._async.debounce(_this._onAsyncScroll, MIN_SCROLL_UPDATE_DELAY, {\n            leading: false,\n            maxWait: MAX_SCROLL_UPDATE_DELAY\n        });\n        _this._onAsyncIdle = _this._async.debounce(_this._onAsyncIdle, IDLE_DEBOUNCE_DELAY, {\n            leading: false\n        });\n        _this._onAsyncResize = _this._async.debounce(_this._onAsyncResize, RESIZE_DELAY, {\n            leading: false\n        });\n        _this._cachedPageHeights = {};\n        _this._estimatedPageHeight = 0;\n        _this._focusedIndex = -1;\n        _this._scrollingToIndex = -1;\n        _this._pageCache = {};\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Scroll to the given index.
