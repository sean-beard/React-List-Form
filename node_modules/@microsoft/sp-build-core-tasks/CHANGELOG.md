### Minor changes

- During dev-deploy, allow the user to specify a test page using the  dev_deploy_url environment variable. The task will then print a full URL, which helps reduce the need for manual string manipulation during testing

- Updated the webpack visualization plugin to use webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Upgraded to Webpack 2.0
- Added IConfigEntry

- Added the ability to exclude filename hashes for the CopyAssets task
- Ensured the "*" version is replaced with the real version in the produced JS file

- Fixed a minor issue where localized paths in debug manifests produced in --ship mode are missing a default entry

- Ensured that multiple config.json entries don't point to the same input or output filenames
- Included CSS as a default extension that's automatically copied from src to lib
- Allowed the webpack stats data files to be dropped in a location in addition to temp/stats
- Debug manifests should respect debugLocale in manifest's localized strings
- Lock loader-utils version, as newer version shows deprecation warnings when using css-loader
