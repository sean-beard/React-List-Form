/**
 * This structure is used to define metadata for web part propeties as a map of string to IWebPartPropertyMetadata
 * The key should be a json path to the property in web part propeties. The json path supports the following operators:
 * - Dot . for selecting object members e.g. person.name
 * - Brackets [] for selecting array items e.g. person.photoURLs[0]
 * - Bracketed asterisk [*] for array elements wildcard e.g. person.websites[*].
 *
 * You can make combinations of these operators e.g. person.websites[*].url
 * Important Note: Only one wildcard per path is supported.
 *
 * Example: Let's assume we have a web part with properties that have the following schema:
 * {
 *   title: string;
 *   person: {
 *     name: string;
 *     bio: string;
 *     photoURLs: string[];
 *     websites: { title: string; url: string; }[]
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * We can define the metadata for the desired properties as following:
 * {
 *  'person.bio': { isRichContent: true },
 *  'person.photoURLs[*]': { isImageSource: true },
 *  'person.websites[*].url': { isLink: true }
 * }
 *
 * This will make SharePoint servers aware of the content of your properties and run services such as search indexing,
 * link fix-up, etc on the data. In case any of the values needs to update by these services, e.g link fix-up, the
 * web part property bag is automatically updated.
