 * {component}{area}{state}
 *
 * component: (optional) a optional conceptual component, which may align to many variations.
 * area: the area within the component, usually either background or text color.
 * state: one of { Hover, Pressed, Selected, HoverSelected, Disabled, SelectionHighlight or FocusStroke }
