/**
 * The collection of semantic slots for colors used in themes.
 *
 * ## Naming Convention
 *
 * The name of a semantic slot can quickly tell you how it’s meant to be used. It generally follows this format:
 *
 * [category name][element name][checked state][hovered/pressed/disabled state]
 * [category name] – The “family” that this slot belongs to.
 * [element name] – The name of the thing being targeted, such as the background or border.
 * [checked state] – Whether the thing is checked. We assume things are unchecked by default, so no need to specify the unchecked state.
 * (We used “checked” to refer to anything that is on, selected, toggled, highlighted, emphasized, etc.)
 * [hovered/pressed/disabled state] – One of these states, if applicable. Each of these states are mutually exclusive.
 * Pressed styles overwrite hovered styles, and disabled elements cannot be hovered or pressed.
 *
 * ## Base Slots
 *
 * A basic set of slots that provide many default body styles, such as text, subtext, disabled colors, and so on.
 * If a category doesn't provide the slot you're looking for, use one from this category.
 * For example, the placeholder text on a text input field has no corresponding slot in its category,
 * so you'd use the bodySubtextColor from this category.
 *
 * ## Invariants
 *
 * When color has meaning, we do not want to change the color much theme to theme. For example, we
 * will always want errors to be some shade of red, but we will need to tweak the exact shade so it's
 * legible depending on whether it's an inverted theme or not.
 * Invariant colors should almost never be changed by the theme, the defaults should suffice.
 *
 * ## Input Controls
 *
 * This category contains input components commonly used to denote state, including radio buttons,
 * check boxes, toggle switches, sliders, progress bars, and more.
 *
 * ## Menus
 *
 * Any kind of popup menus uses this category.
 *
 * ## Lists
 *
 * Lists differ from menus in that they are designed to show infinite amounts of items, often scroll,
 * and have a large and complex interaction surface.
 * This category covers all kinds of lists, whether they're typical one-item-per-row lists (like DetailsList) or ones with a tiled layout.
